# Etch-A-Sketch
In this project, I have built a browser-based sketchpad using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate my skills in DOM manipulation.

You can try the live app [here](https://edwardjohnfelicia.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/).

## How to use
To use the Etch-A-Sketch, simply hover your mouse over the squares to draw. The color of each square changes with each pass. After 10 passes, the color will turn to black.

To create a new grid, click the "New Grid" button in the top bar and enter the desired number of squares per side. The maximum number of squares is 100.
