# Etch-A-Sketch
## Overview
Etch-A-Sketch is a browser-based sketchpad that allows users to create art by hovering their mouse over a grid of squares. The color of each square changes with each pass, creating a unique and colorful design. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and demonstrates the developer's skills in DOM manipulation. The project includes a "New Grid" button that allows users to create a new grid with a customizable number of squares per side, with a maximum limit of 100 squares to prevent performance issues.

## Live app

## How to use
To use the Etch-A-Sketch, simply hover your mouse over the squares to draw. The color of each square changes with each pass. After 10 passes, the color will turn to black.

To create a new grid, click the "New Grid" button in the top bar and enter the desired number of squares per side. The maximum number of squares is 100.
